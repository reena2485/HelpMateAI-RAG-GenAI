Semantic Search System for Policy Documents

**Overview:**
This project focuses on creating a semantic search system tailored for policy documents, integrating advanced techniques for document processing, vector embeddings, and coherent answer generation. The system comprises three key layers: embedding, searching, and generation, each optimized for enhanced performance.

**Performance Evaluation:**
Thoroughly assess the impact of different strategies, models, and components on system performance.Consider scalability by addressing potential increases in document numbers or user queries.
Getting Started:
1. Install the required libraries: `pip install pdfplumber tiktoken openai chromaDB sentence-transformers -q`.
2. Mount Google Drive: `from google.colab import drive; drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)`.
3. Follow step-by-step instructions in the codebase to implement the Embedding, Search, and Generation layers.
